# Research Interests

I am primarily interested in evaluating digital psychosocial interventions for 
psychosis. Secondary interests include just about everything linked to psychosis/extreme mental states. Including contributions from neuroscience, philosophy and sociology. I believe psychosis is incredibly complex and needs many kinds of expertise to be researched effectively.
