# Education

## PhD, Implementation Science, University of Glasgow

My PhD research (commenced October 2017) examines process evaluation within complex digital interventions for psychosis, utilising the EMPOWER trial as a case study.

<a href="https://empowerstudy.net/"> EMPOWER </a> is an innovative research project which aims to develop and evaluate an App for use with adults who experience psychosis. The App will enable routine self-monitoring for a variety of different experiences, including psychotic experiences (e.g. hearing voices, experiencing suspicious thoughts), anxiety, mood and self-esteem. The EMPOWER team includes psychologists, researchers, nurses and peer support workers.

## MA(SocSci) Psychology, University of Glasgow


I graduated in 2017. My final year project explored mental health staff perceptions of digital technology usage in managing psychosis, jointly supervised by professors Andrew Gumley and Stephany Biello. This work was also completed within EMPOWER. I presented the results at The International Society for Research on Internet Interventions (ISRII) in Berlin October 2017.

I was a joint winner of the Pickford Prize for best performance in social psychology for the class of 2017.
